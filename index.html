            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Increasing traffic congestion is one of the biggest problems facing big cities such as New York and Shanghai.
                To tackle this challenge, cities have been trying out different market mechanisms to curb increasing traffic. 
                New York have been thinking about implementing road congestion pricing. 
                Shanghai, however, decided to curb traffic by auctioning off a limited supply of license plates every month.
                Up until 2008, Shanghai have been using a single bid auctioning format. But as license plate price
                soared, Shanghai decided to switch auctioning format by allowing bidder to revise their bids. Our project aims to determine
                whether the new format helped with curbing the rising license prices. </p>

            <h2>A Little About The Auction</h2>
            <p>Prior to 2008, Shanghai used an auction format where bidders submit their bid once, and the highest bidders get allocated
                with the license plates. The pricing is "discriminatory", meaning that the winning bidders pay their own bids. 
                The only information available is the minimum accepted price of the previous rounds. </p>
            <p>As the price of license plates keeps rising, Shanghai government decided to change the auction format with the goal of lowering license
                price for the bidders. The new auction allows for two revisions of initial bid prices. The revisions must fall within a narrow
                price window of around $50 around the lowest accepted bid. </p>

            <h2>Relevant Literature</h2>
            <p>This project takes inspiration from Prof. Holt's 2013 paper on Shanghai license plate auctions. 
                The authors of the paper simulated four versions of the auction in a lab experiment:  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first two were simplified versions of the real auction format used in Shanghai pre-2008 and post-2008. </li>
                <li>The third auction format was a uniform price auction where bidders could only bid once, similar to pre-2008 Shanghai auction,
                    but all the winning bidders pay the same price (highest rejected price since it will clear the market) 
                    instead of their own bidding price. </li>
                <li>The final auction is similar to the post-2008 format except the initial bids were submitted without any information 
                    provided about the lowest acceptable price. The purpose of this revised new auction treatment was to assess the 
                    relative importance of the two components of the new Shanghai auction, 
                    the initial bid and the revisions of the initial bid.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>In a lab setting, Holt demonstrated that Shanghaiâ€™s new auction format was able to reduce the license price. 
                In actuality, however, after implementing the new auction format, 
                the license price at first drastically grew up and then stabilized at a much higher price level. 
                Our study was to discover whether the new auction format has actually led to the price increase.</p>

            <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
            
            <p>First, we plotted different data against time to see if there is any notable differences between before and after
                the change in auction format: </p>
            
            <p>This graph shows the average and minimum price for the license plates:</p>
            
            <img src="https://cf4ff.github.io/uvammm-license-auction/img/prices.png" alt="license plate prices">
            
            <p>As we can see, the change in auction format seemingly only had a short term effect in curbing the prices. After the 
                auction format changed in 2008, we did see a decrease in price. However since then, the price has steadily recovered, 
                continue to increase throughout the years, and plateaued in 2017. Another pattern can be observed from the graphs: 
                the difference between average and minimum price have been getting smaller and after 2014, 
                they seem to be perfectly tracking each other. Here is another plot to get a better look: </p>
            
            <img src="https://cf4ff.github.io/uvammm-license-auction/img/pricediff.png" alt="average price and minimum price difference">
            
            <p>We could probably contribute this trend to the price window around minimum accepted bid where all revisions must 
                fall within. This caused the bids to have a much tighter spread which is consist with the graph. </p>
                
            <p>Next we looked at the number of license plates under auction each month and the number of bidders: </p>
            
            <img src="https://cf4ff.github.io/uvammm-license-auction/img/quota.png" alt="license plate quota and num of applicants">
            
            <p>Though it is not obvious in the graph, Shanghai has been in fact increasing its quotas every year. 
                The number of license plates available in 2018 is about 10 times what it was in 2002. 
                However, this effort dwarfs in comparison with the increase in bidders through out the years. </p>
            
            <p>Finally, we plotted other socio-economic factors that we thought might be correlated with bid prices: </p>
