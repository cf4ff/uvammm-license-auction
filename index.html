            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Increasing traffic congestion is one of the biggest problems facing big cities such as New York and Shanghai.
                To tackle this challenge, cities have been trying out different market mechanisms to curb increasing traffic. 
                New York have been thinking about implementing road congestion pricing. 
                Shanghai, however, decided to curb traffic by auctioning off a limited supply license plates every month.
                Up until 2008, Shanghai have been using a closed information, single bid auctioning format. But as license plate price
                soared, Shanghai decided to switch auctioning format by allowing bidder to revise their bids. Our project aims to determine
                whether the new format helped with curbing the rising license prices. </p>

            <h2>A little about the auction</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>This project takes inspiration from Prof. Holt's 2013 paper on Shanghai license plate auctions. 
                In a lab setting, Holt demonstrated that Shanghaiâ€™s new auction format was able to reduce the license price in lab simulation. 
                In actuality, however, after implementing the new auction format, 
                the license price at first drastically grew up and then stabilized at a much higher price level. 
                Our study was to discover whether the new auction format has actually led to the price increase.</p>
